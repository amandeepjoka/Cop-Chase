# Cop-Chase
An open world racing game with vivid 3D graphics.
Cop chase is my individual effort at creating a large scale, graphic intense racing game. In this game everything from level design, map design, game play conceptualization and  implementation was done by me, Freely available unity artwork assets were utilized in this project.

The game takes place in an urban city background, with AI cars and police cars and a user controlled car in which you escape the cop cars by loosing their tail.
During this project a lot of concepts such as raycast, terrain creation, collision avoiding etc. were learned.
Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating it.
